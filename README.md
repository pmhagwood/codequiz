# Code Quiz
## A timed quiz with high scores


This directory contains a timed code quiz. I worked to create a code quiz with Javascript. The quiz is timed so each question will be either right or wrong and if wrong it will remove 10 seconds from the timer and alert the user. At the end of the quiz the user can enter their name for a high score. This is recorded on the high score page.
